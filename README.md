WEB-270 Web Development Project (Project Bookhaven)

## Bookhaven Summary
During this project, I was tasked to create a webpage for out of a selection of three clients, one of them was Bookhaven. Bookhaven is an online bookstore that sells various book genres and related products. I had to create four pages (Home, Gallery, About, and a Custom page). During this project, I had to use my .CSS, HTML, and .JS knowledge I learned during the course of this class to create an appealing UI/UX experience through the process of front and backend development.
